## API

## Development Roadmap

1. Use MobX (https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) to manage state in front end.
2. Break the front end into smaller components (e.g., individual components for each button type rather than reusing a generic button type and passing in props).
3. Refactor to use styled components.
4. Add feature: allow users to sort and filter shipments by order status, address, and other criteria.
5. Unit test front end.
6. Display courier name instead of ID in Management Dashboard.
7. Use Socket.io or other websocket technology to update Manager Dashboard and Courier Web To-Do Tool in realtime when shipments are created or updated.
8. Use sessions, login, and authentication to ensure only authorized managers and couriers can access the tools.
9. Do more thorough testing of API endpoints and integration tests.
